                ### Research Neuroplasticity
                <br><br>
                <u>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</u>
                <br>
                - Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity opens our world to the fact that when we learn,
                we form new pathways in the brain. We can figure out how to purposefully rewire the brain, that
                we can get smarter, better, or more skilled at something through sustained effort!
                <br><br>
                <u>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</u>
                <br>
                - I read this in an article of how to get started and I was so surprised to see that I had started going it already! Here goes:
                <br><br>
                Challenge > Intention > Specific Attention > Repetition & Intensity > Time
                <br><br>
                Here's how the example works for me: 
                <br><br>
                Challenge (coding) > Intention (For me it's creating kickass design projects) > 
                Specific Attention (Plan. Structure. Goal. Incentive) > Repetition & Intensity (Check in) > Time (Plan for lapses – it’s normal. Refocus, adjust, keep going.)
                <br><br>
                <u>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</u>
                <br>
                - Mindfulness.
                <br>
                - Journaling and meditating. Even if it's just 5 mins a day. I also enjoy a quick sketch or painting to
                help set the day right.
                <br>
                - Some form of exercise. Or dance.
                <br>
                - Sleep and eat well.

                    Ways to Increase Neuroplasticity!</a>
                <br><br>
                ### Research Growth Mindset
                <br><br>
                <u>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</u>
                <br>
                - Neuroplasticity and a growth mindset mirror each other. It can help you overcome obstacles 
                when learning something new. It helps you understand the importance of persistence and determination, and the fact that you can control/rewire your brain to be that way. Game change, I'm tell you! 
                By changing the way you think, you can change the way you learn and that's essential when immersing yourself in a 15 week bootcamp!
                <br><br>
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUJkbWNnNy4">This one! Even it's animation! So cute!</a>
                <br><br>
                <u>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</u>
                <br><br>
                - I had moments of reality checks that hey, I can get better at anything I want to with a growth mindset,
                practise, etc. It's
                cool to know that you got the power to be better!
                <br><br>
                <u>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</u>
                <br>
                - I hope to integrate it by being more organised, having a structure and switching to my hustle mindset. More confidence! More learning!
                <br><br>
                <u>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</u>
                <br>
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENsD57ifdoo">- Talks by Aren Bahia</a>, I met him in one of the
                festivals I went to,
                and I really enjoy listening to people I have met and look upto, to help me see a bigger picture. All 
                of his talks are funny and apt for where I'm at in life.
                <br><br>
                <u>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</u>
                <br><br>
                I'm definetly feeling focussed after learning about a growth mindset, neuroplasticity, etc. 
                It helped me have a reason to use these skills after the course, and is going to be my drive for staying motivated throughout.
