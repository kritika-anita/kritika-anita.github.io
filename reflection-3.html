      # Mindfulness 
      <br><br>
      ### Do you have any biases for or against mindfulness? If so, can you describe them?
      <br>
      No, not at all. I find great value in it. I have been hoping to learn more about it and Dev Academy's presenting the perfect opportunity to do so.
      <br><br>
      
      ### How did you find the overall experience? 
      <br>
      The overall experience has been interesting. I like building habbits and I like that aspect, and I am curious to see the long term benefits throughout the course and after.
      
      <br><br>
      ### What's your daily habit commitment? 
      <br>
      My Daily habbit commitment is waking up early and saying positive affirmations to myself to feel happier each day.
      <br><br>
      
      # Listening and Looping 
      <br><br>
      ### What was it like to be fully listened to? 
      <br>
      It was really calming knowing someone is just listening, fully, and I felt zero judgement which was awesome!
      <br><br>
      
      ### What was it like to fully listen?
      <br>
      I felt like I really understood what they were saying and I definetly enjoyed the conversation more while fully listening. I definetly plan to impliment it in my daily life. 
      <br><br>

      ### What did you notice about your learning style? What resources worked for you and why? 
      <br>
      The freecodecamp has been really helpful.
      <br><br>
      
      ### Did you keep within the timebox suggestions? If not, was it due to difficulty understanding the basics, or a feeling like you had to _master_ the basics?
      <br>
      When I took hints in the freecodecamp, I got worked up about it and wondered if I wasn't getting it which is why I needed the hints. That messed up my self esteem a little, cause in html and css I barely saw the hints.  So, yea I definetly felt like I had to master the basics.

      # DevTools Tutorial
      <br><br>
      ### What did you notice about your learning style, strengths, and limitations when doing this crash course?
      <br>
      I enjoy ticking off a checklist, so I did that with freecodecamp. When the timebox is very long, I delay even starting it, which I am trying to change. Shorter prompts, even if there are many seem so easy to complete, even if they are a difficult concept. 
      <br><br>
      ### Did any blocks come up for you? How did you overcome them?
      <br>
      I googled it and took the hints and solutions online. I also took multiple breaks when I realised I am not grasping a topic and went easy on myself.
      <br><br>
      ### How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?
      <br>
      I have one of 2 non-study related tabs open right now. The ratio is 2:6.
      <br><br>
      ### Did you do something funny with the Dev Tools, like insert your own name or some inappropriate words into the DOM of a website? If not, do so now. It's hilarious and a great way to amuse your non-technical friends. They will think you are a hacker wizard.
      <br>
      Oh I haven't done that, but it sounds like fun and I am going to do it right now!
