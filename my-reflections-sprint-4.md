# My Reflections - Sprint Four 

# Code Readability

### What makes code more readable for you?

When you know where the code ends & text/content begins.
And when it's easy to differentiate between code & text/content.
### Do you prefer tabs or spaces when indenting?

Spaces! Your text editor lets you customise spaces and indent multiple lines if needed!

### What is your workspace like in real life? Clean? Messy? Is your code a reflection of that?

I call it an organised mess. Yea it probably is. I would like my code to be more organised though.


# Testing

```
function testSum(){
    var expected = 7
    var actual = sum(5, 2)

    if (actual != expected) {
        console.log("It's broken..")
    } else {
        console.log("It works!")
    }
}
```
### Have a go at writing a "sum" function below that would make the above function print out `"It works!"`: 

console.log(testSum(7));
// expected output: "It works!"

### Do you think you would prefer using Unit Testing or Test Driven Development? Why?

I would prefer using Test Driven Development, cause it would be useful to have a big picture that works, and then refactor to make it more concise. This may help is saving time in the future, as I can write the test before I impliment it.


# Kata

### How did you find using repl.it in practice? Confusing? Useful?


### Was it helpful to look at the tests while coding the kata?


### What problem solving techniques did you implement in your coding flow?


### What was the most challenging part of Super FizzBuzz for you?


### Did you want to change and refactor your code once you were finished?
