      <u> What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</u>
      <br><br><br>
      - Communication Designer. Working with organisations that care and give back. Hope to use coding to enchance my skills of: UI/UX- Making Websites, Apps, Graphic Design, AR, Visual Art, all things creative.
      <br><br><br>
      <u> A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</u>
      <br><br><br>
-  In the right environment I am very focussed, work extremely hard and achieve anything I set my mind to. I can make learning fun for myself and everyone around me. <br>
However, I get restless with a lot of reading. I've come to understand that I don't always understand the generic logical analogies. I need an emotional example to understand concepts. 
      <br><br><br>
      <u> What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</u>
      <br><br><br>
- Confidence that I can do anything techinical and self-validation. 
      <br><br><br>
      <u>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
        An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives
        What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</u>
        <br><br><br>
- I plan to get a good nights sleep so I am well rested to focus better. I will be kind and understanding towards myself and everyone around me. My timebox and me will be best friends. Pomodoro too.
        <br><br><br>
      <u> A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</u><br><br><br>
     - For work help, I'll google it, reach out to the facilitators or the people around me. Emotionally, I will call a loved one/ walk/ get yummy food. 

      <br><br><br>
      <u> A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</u>
      <br><br><br>
- Kindness, respect and patience. I come from a design and arts education background + different culture and therefore have different ways of learning. I will communicate when I don't understand an explanation and would love if the team is patient with me. A check in every other day would be awesome.
<br><br><br>
       <u> Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.
        These elements do not need to be structured as they are in this list. You should put them together in the way that you feel they are most clearly communicated.</u>
      <br><br><br>
- I may teach kids art on Saturday mornings. I dont think there is anything else.
