        # What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
        <br><br>
        "If ego is confidence, it can get in the way of our ability to lead and make decisions. Ego tells us the world
        is
        looking at us. Are we too in love with the vision of our self that prevents us from what we need to do and make
        the necessary decision to reach our goal?"
        <br>
        I read this in a medium article this week and I resonated with these lines. I learnt that I have grown up with
        alot of
        people telling me that I am not good at math and somewhere I started to beleive it. Unnlearning it has been very
        challenging,
        but I am trying. I feel pressure to excel at every step of the way in this course, which is crazy cause I
        literally just started
        learning! I learnt that I judge myself if I don't get something right in the first try. I am definetly working
        on being kinder to myself. I am also learning that I HAVE to train my brain to be resilient as it loves to protect me from anything it seems like a threat/challenge.

        <br><br>
        # What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?
        <br><br>
        "In programming, or learning in general, understanding the brains dynamic role in achieving goals is very important.
        Specifically the awareness around toxic thoughts, feelings and ideas. Challenges + (Resilience + Intrinsic Drive) = Impact" is a reading a came across which reflects why self awarenness is crucial when programming. 


        <br><br>
        # What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
        <br><br>
        I love the core learning. I enjoy reflecting and writing. I love learning new ways of strengthening our minds,
        concentration and reflecting. It helped me realise I am much more positive than I thought I am, even when I was struggling so
        much! Core also made me calmer to proceed with each sprint.

        <br><br>
        # What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
        <br><br>
        The most challenging part was truly beleiving that core has immense value. The tech part is obviously important,
        but a part of me always felt like core is fun and easy, in compasrison to tech, so I can do it later. However,
        core preps you for the challenges of tech! 

        <br><br>
        # Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web
        development bootcamp course?
        <br><br>
        I think it's because knowing that we control our mindset, our growth mindset, and how we grow and learn, is
        beneficial when
        you take up any challenges/ problems. It helps with feeling more confident and knowing yourself better because
        you have reflected so much.
        Therefore, we can approach each challenge with awareness which only helps in any work or life situation. Whether
        it's problem solving on your own, with a team or in any environment!

        <br><br>
        # Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that
        time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.
        <br><br>
        I think it's helped me look back at how much I have grown in the past 5 weeks, almost like a foundations
        learning/ awareness journal.
        I think it's setting roots for a lifetime of learning ahead of me.
