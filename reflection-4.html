          # My Reflections - Sprint Four
          <br><br>
          # Code Readability
          <br><br>
          ### What makes code more readable for you?
          <br><br>

          When you know where the code ends & text/content begins.
          And when it's easy to differentiate between code & text/content.
          ### Do you prefer tabs or spaces when indenting?
          <br>

          Spaces! Your text editor lets you customise spaces and indent multiple lines if needed!
          <br><br>

          ### What is your workspace like in real life? Clean? Messy? Is your code a reflection of that?
          <br>

          I call it an organised mess. Yea it probably is. I would like my code to be more organised though.
          <br><br>


          # Testing
          <br><br>


          function testSum(){
          <br>
          var expected = 7
          <br>
          var actual = sum(5, 2)
          <br>

          if (actual != expected) {
          <br>
          console.log("It's broken..")
          <br>
          } else {
          <br>
          console.log("It works!")
          <br>
          }
          <br>
          }
          <br><br>
          ### Have a go at writing a "sum" function below that would make the above function print out `"It works!"`:
          <br><br>
          console.log(testSum(7));
          <br>
          // expected output: "It works!"
          <br><br>
          ### Do you think you would prefer using Unit Testing or Test Driven Development? Why?
          <br>
          I would prefer using Test Driven Development, cause it would be useful to have a big picture that works, and
          then refactor to make it more concise. This may help is saving time in the future, as I can write the test
          before I impliment it.
          <br><br>
          # Kata
          <br><br>
          ### How did you find using repl.it in practice? Confusing? Useful?
          <br>
          It was a little confusing. I am curious to use it in the bootcamp to be able to run codes and definetly see
          it's value to write our own code and save multiple files!
          <br><br>
          ### Was it helpful to look at the tests while coding the kata?
          <br>
          Yes, there is definelty a sense of validation that one is on the right track. I'm sure once we get into more
          complex code writing, it'll be of so much value since it'll may help to run the code each step of the way.
          <br><br>
          ### What problem solving techniques did you implement in your coding flow?
          <br>
          The rubber ducky method is extremely useful and I use google as well. I do a lot of trial and error, even
          though it can get frustrating if multiple attempts don't get you anywhere. I then reach out to the
          facilitators.
          <br><br>
          ### What was the most challenging part of Super FizzBuzz for you?
          <br>
          The most challenging part was remembering which code to use for which part. Also, making sense of why looping
          works the way it does, the order, and which brackects to use inside which array, super confusing!
          <br><br>
          ### Did you want to change and refactor your code once you were finished?
          <br>
          Yea, I used lse if statements and not each line separately. I also got feedback from a friend which helped
          clean up the code annd was very helpful.
